Misc:
	1. Human input screen not going away when ai is thinking

AI stuff:
	1. Fix bugs
		i. It's not finding certain moves, idk why
	2. Heavily optimize brute force move scraping
		i. Cache/check for redundancy as much as possible
		ii. Better data structures

Data generator:
	1. File output that, for each move, stores all data about the move and the eventual outcome for the player of the move
		1. Word (feature extraction? Length, contained_letters, etc)
		2. Initial square of move
		3. Score of the move
		4. Direction
		5. Board state (feature extraction? Num_tiles, proximity to triple words?)
		6. Result of game for player of move (1,-1)
		7. Special case handling for skip
		8. Rack

Start project report:
	1. Section on scrabble game design
	2. Section on is_valid_move
